A Search Engine

This is a tiny search engine for the website http://nba.hupu.com.
Hupu is an extremly popular basketball website. Almost, all of the baskteball fans in China will visit Hupu to get the fresh basketball news everyday. But there is a small leak for this website that it doesn't have an avaliable search interface. So if I want to know the news about Kobe Bryant, I have no better ways than click the related news for Lakers. So I write a mini search interface for it.

Temporarily, it could only grab the website who begin with http://voice.hupu.com.

In this program, I set five threads, and you could change it based on your hardware.

We used the China Academy of Science's ictclas algorithm to handle the Chinese Word Segmentation problem.

And the core algorithm we used is textrank, which is derived from the famous PageRank algorithm invented by Google.
